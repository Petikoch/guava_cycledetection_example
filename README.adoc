== Guava CycleDetectingLockFactory, jtwfg ... wtf?

https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] is a feature-rich java library with incredible tools in it,
a must have for almost any Java project out there. It includes since version 13.0 the CycleDetectingLockFactory class, altough still @Beta even in 18.0.

https://github.com/Petikoch/jtwfg[jtwfg] is a small java library focusing just on finding deadlocks (cycles)
in directed graphs. jtwfg is pretty new (started in late 2014).

== Motivation

My name is Peti Koch. I'm the author of jtwfg and didn't know about Guava's CycleDetectingLockFactory when I started jtwfg.
I wondered if Guava's CycleDetectingLockFactory could solve the same problem as jtwfg and therefore jtwfg is obsolete and could be deleted.

== Analysis

I checked out the features of Guava's CycleDetectingLockFactory using link:src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/guava/Guava_CycleDetection_Example.groovy[these tests] (based on Groovy/Spock).
