== Guava CycleDetectingLockFactory, jtwfg ... wtf?

https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] is a feature-rich java library with incredible tools in it,
a must have for almost any Java project out there. It includes since version 13.0 the CycleDetectingLockFactory class, altough still @Beta, even in 18.0.

https://github.com/Petikoch/jtwfg[jtwfg] is a small java library focusing just on finding deadlocks (cycles)
in directed graphs. jtwfg is pretty new (started in late 2014).

== Motivation

My name is Peti Koch. I'm the author of jtwfg and didn't know about Guava's CycleDetectingLockFactory when I started jtwfg.
I wondered if Guava's CycleDetectingLockFactory could solve the same problem as jtwfg and therefore jtwfg is obsolete and could be deleted.

== Analysis

I checked out the features of Guava's CycleDetectingLockFactory using a Groovy/Spock based link:src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/guava/Guava_CycleDetection_Example.groovy[test]
and a "plain" JUnit 3.x link:src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/guava/CycleDetectingLockFactoryTest.java[test].
Pretty soon, I stopped wondering about the tests and writing tests, because there is a special approach used in CycleDetectingLockFactory.

=== Analysis regarding cycle detection / deadlock finding

There are two main differences between the guava class and jtwfg.

==== Difference 1: Preventing vs Detecting

===== CycleDetectingLockFactory: Preventing.

Guava's CycleDetectingLockFactory ensures, that there is no cycle in the lock *acquisition* *order*, to *prevent* *potential* deadlocks.
Again, it's about checking the lock *acquisition* *order*. This approach comes with the price of _false positives_ footnote:[https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2042].
To understand this approach, read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)#Types[Wikipedia]:
_"Careless use of locks can result in deadlock or livelock. A number of strategies can be used to avoid or recover from deadlocks or livelocks, both at design-time and at run-time. (The most common strategy is to standardize the lock acquisition sequences so that combinations of inter-dependent locks are always acquired and released in a specifically defined "cascade" order.)"._

CycleDetectingLockFactory helps you to enforce the rule "that locks may only be obtained in a specially defined cascade order".
If you put this into your code and do unit-testing, integration-testing, manual testing, ... (you somehow run the code in a pre-production manner) you will immediately
notice violations of this rule and hardly ever rollout a production version of your code with "illegal lock acquisition order".
You will not have deadlocks.

===== jtwfg: Detecting. And Preventing?

jtwfg *analyzes* a current situation to check, if there *is* a deadlock situation.

What about using jtwfg also for deadlock preventing? With no false-positives? Let's assume we hook into (intercept) the
"dependency building process" at runtime: There is one task trying to add a new dependency to another task. Before allowing this,
we build the current situation (task wait for graph model), check for deadlocks (none expected in the graph area of interest) and add then the new task/dependency
and check for deadlocks again. If there is no deadlock (in the graph area of interest), we *allow* the new dependency, otherwise we reject it (throwing an exception, ...)
to prevent the deadlock. If you have an amazing test-coverage of your code, covering all possible scenarios with different lock acquisition orders,
and run these tests in pre-production, you will not have deadlocks in production. But in a typically shared-state / concurrent code-world,
with it's intrinsic non-deterministic execution order, it will be extremely hard / impossible to cover all scenarios as soon as you have let's say more than 3 locks.
So, you'll have no real warranty to have no deadlocks in production, but you will have no false positives.

Ok, so what about doing the same as CycleDetectingLockFactory and also enforce the "lock acquisition order rule" using jtwfg?
You'll have to build/maintain a jtwfg "task wait for graph model" "only" for the lock acquisition order,
not for the state "who is dependent on who at the moment". That's of course possible. Remember, this comes with the *price* of false positives and
reduces the freedom for lock acquisition order, with the *benefit* of more "safety".

===== CycleDetectingLockFactory: Detecting?

What about extending Guava's CycleDetectingLockFactory for *detection*? Well, for deadlock-situations associated with threads and *locks*
there is already Java's built in `java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean` class, which implements this footnote:[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/management/ThreadMXBean.html].

==== Difference 2: Domain Model

Guava's CycleDetectingLockFactory focuses on Java's `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock` domain.
Although it uses internally a generic graph domain model, you would have to transform your domain model
to `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock` 's, if you would like to use it's cycle detection/prevention mechanism.

jtwfg has a generic task wait for graph model.

== Summary

This comparison helped me a lot to better understand the typical way to prevent deadlocks:
Enforce the lock acquisition order. Probably you're interested also in a discussion which I had
with Darick Tong from Google: Check out https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2042.
